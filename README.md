# CNC_Alternative_Bot
Created prototype for a mobile robot with a mounted drawing device to research portable and affordable solutions to CNC Mills. System involves the use of an Arduino board, robotics localization methods, PID control loops and Zigbee communication.

The plan for this robot design is to have a portable robot drive to specific coordinates on a 2D surface and etch out designs with a drawing device. Only the robot driving and navigation methods have been studied so far. The localization methods ultimately decided for this design involve (1) real-time 2D localization using odometry and (2) instant localization corrections with the use of reflective strips spaced evenly along the drawing surface reflected by a laser emmiter/receiver.
